# Take back your browser

Bromite is Chromium plus ad blocking and privacy enhancements; take back your browser!

## Goals
Bromite aims at providing a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.

Minimal UI changes are applied to help curbing the idea of "browser as an advertisement platform".

## Main features
* baked-in adblock engine with filters from EasyList, EasyPrivacy and others
* remove click-tracking and AMP from search results
* DNS-over-HTTPS support
* allow playing videos in background
* [&rarr; StartPage](https://startpage.com/), [&rarr; DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [&rarr; Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/) search engines
* privacy enhancement patches from [&rarr; Iridium](https://iridiumbrowser.de/), [&rarr; Inox patchset](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset), [&rarr; Brave](https://brave.com/) and [&rarr; ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) projects
* webRTC, canvas, audio and other anti-fingerprinting mitigations
* all codecs included (proprietary, open H.264 etc.)
* built with official speed optimizations
