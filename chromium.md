# Chromium releases

As part of the Bromite project the vanilla Chromium releases (built with same settings and optimizations of Bromite, but no patches) are provided.
This is mostly useful to detect new features/bugs in Chromium and compare functionality with Bromite, but it is as well a 100% vanilla working Chromium browser (with all the pros/cons).
