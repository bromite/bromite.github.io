# Chromium releases

<img title="Chromium - provided by Bromite project" src="/chromium.png" width="96" alt="Chromium" />

As part of the Bromite project the vanilla Chromium releases (built with same settings and optimizations of Bromite, but no patches) are provided.
This is mostly useful to detect new features/bugs in Chromium and compare functionality with Bromite, but it is as well a 100% vanilla working Chromium browser (with all the pros/cons).
