# Maintenance release for DoH issue

This new Bromite 69.0.3497.113 release disables support of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) until the upstream bug has been fixed (see [Github issue](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues/139)); this is expected to happen with the first version 70 release.

No other Bromite-specific changes in this release.

Please report any bugs via the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues).
