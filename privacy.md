# Privacy Policy

The Bromite Project is an informal volunteer association of individuals who have made common cause to maintain and develop the patches
which allow to build the Bromite browser.

There is no requirement for anyone who wishes to use Bromite to provide the project with any personal information; it is freely downloadable without registration or other form of identification from both official mirrors and third parties.

Some aspects of interacting with the Bromite Project will involve the collection of personal information, namely:
* browsing the Bromite Official Website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages
* the automatic updates of subresource filters used for the AdBlocking functionality, enabled by default, which downloads a file hosted on GitHub Pages
* the automatic check and update of Bromite itself, enabled by default, which checks for headers on a a file hosted on GitHub Project Releases and allows to download it
* using the Bromite Official F-Droid repository

The following subsections describe the information collected.
